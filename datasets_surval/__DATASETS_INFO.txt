In a 1991 Australian study by Caplehorn et al., two methadone treatment clinics for heroin addicts were compared
to assess patient time remaining under methadone treatment. A patient’s survival time was determined as the time
(in days) until the person dropped out of the clinic or was censored. The two clinics differed according to its live-in
policies for patients. The variables are defined as follows:
- ID: Patient ID
- SURVT: The time (in days) until the patient dropped out of the clinic or was censored
- STATUS: Indicates whether the patient dropped out of the clinic (coded 1) or was censored (coded 0)
- CLINIC: Indicates which methadone treatment clinic the patient attended (coded 1 or 2)
- PRISON: Indicates whether the patient had a prison record (coded 1) or not (coded 0)
- DOSE: A continuous variable for the patient’s maximum methadone dose (mg/day)

The bladder cancer dataset contains recurrent event outcome information for eighty-six cancer patients followed
for the recurrence of bladder cancer tumor after transurethral surgical excision(ByarandGreen1980).The exposure
of interest is the effect of the drug treatment of thiotepa. Control variables are the initial number and initial size of
tumors.The data layoutis suitable for acounting processes approach. The variables are defined as follows:
- ID: Patient ID (may have multiple observations for the same subject)
- EVENT: Indicates whether the patient had a tumor (coded 1) or not (coded 0)
- INTERVAL: A counting number representing the order of the time interval for a given subject (coded 1 for the
subject’s first time interval, coded 2 for a subject’s second time interval, etc.)
- START: The starting time (in months) for each interval
- STOP: The time of event (in months) or censorship for each interval
- TX: Treatment status (coded 1 for treatment with thiotepa and 0 for the placebo)
- NUM: The initial number of tumors
- SIZE: The initial size (in centimeters) of the tumor
